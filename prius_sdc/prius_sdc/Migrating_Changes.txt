1) Set cropheight to 360 , 400 or 500 was a bit too  much
2) Adjust color parameters to remove saturation afect
   Minimize Hue range for white and yellow as they are one color mostly
   Increase Lightnes to only get sharp colors
3) Set Thickness of Midlane_twoside_seperated to 1 from 2 as it was too thick and unnecasary
4) Cutting of yellow lane ( Function: Ret_LowestEdgePoints )from above and below was two much 15 and 25 down to 5 said we get similar height of outerlane as midlane


Things too do:
